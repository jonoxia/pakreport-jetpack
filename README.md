This Jetpack-based Firefox addon does a few things to make
[CrisisCamp][] volunteering easy.

Right now, it does the following:

  * The SMS message on [pakreport.crowdflower.com][] is positioned at
    a fixed place at the top-left of the screen, and stays there as
    you scroll, so you don't have to constantly try locating it over
    and over.

The addon should run on Firefox 3.6 and 4.0 betas. If you're using
4.0, you should be able to use it without restarting your browser.
